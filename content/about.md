We are the Johns Hopkins University chapter of Omega Psi, the national undergraduate honor society for Cognitive Science. The purpose of Omega Psi is to raise awareness of Cognitive Science and provide opportunities in research, community service, and networking for Johns Hopkins undergraduate students.  We believe that it is important to encourage collaboration and build relationships with other students and faculty in a major as diverse as Cognitive Science. To learn more about Omega Psi, visit the [national honor societyâ€™s website](https://omegapsi.org).
